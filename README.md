## Bank Credit Approval includes Feature Selection Methods(Project)
        In machine learning algorithms, one of the biggest problems is
    scarcity of time and requirement of huge datasets. Feature selection
    provides optimization for these matters. Reducing time and amount of
    data required can change the fitness of the model significantly. By aiming
    this, feature selection algorithms are very important.
    In order to see those effects, we consider implementing the
    algorithms which are “consistency-based” and “ correlation-based”
    feature selection. In addition to that, we can also compare the required
    amount of time and data to reach the same fitness levels for the model.
        To pick up a model, we have had a lot of different options but
    among them, we have decided on Bank Marketing Dataset. One of the
    most desired features of our project was finding an appropriate data. We
    have searched on the internet and it has two essential properties that
    first, high number of features and second, a lot of instances available.
    In the model, the classification goal is to predict if the client will
    subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit.
        Overall, we would like to reduce number of attributes and to
    decrease least amount of time to train the model for the same fitness
    levels.
